# Most testbenches end with $finish, so exit codes alone cannot be trusted;
# counting verdict lines also catches silent failures and silently removed tests.

#   ./run_tests.sh             check against tests/expected.txt (CI mode)
#   ./run_tests.sh --baseline  re-record tests/expected.txt from this run

# A target is "<script>[:<argument>]", e.g. build.sh:pmp runs `bash build.sh pmp`.
# A line in tests/expected.txt may end with "# KNOWN: <reason>" to mark a
# documented known failure; the recorded result must still match exactly.
